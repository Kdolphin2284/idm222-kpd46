    <div class="textWritten">
        <p>I took an interaction design class during my spring quarter at Drexel University. 
        For the entirety of the course, we were tasked with redesigning an application of our 
        choosing, while mainly focusing on the micro-interactions of the app. I play a lot of 
        league of legends, so I chose to redesign a “companion” app for the game called OP.GG. 
        This was an app that held valuable information about the game that helps players to get 
        better. I felt that the app didn’t look too bad, but that there were definitely aspects 
        that could be improved, such as the overall user interface, as well as how different 
        interactions appeared to the user.</p>
    <div class="contentImages">
        <img src="../../media/images/poggjOriginals.webp" alt="OP.GG Original Screenshots">
    </div>
        <!-- export the original images separately and make them row wrap, possibly -->

        <p>The first interaction that I decided to work on was the switch from the homepage 
        to the champion page. I chose to change the color of the page icons in the 
        navigation bar depending on what page the user was on. For example, if the user 
        is on the homepage, then the homepage icon in the navigation bar would be a 
        different color than the other icons. For this interaction, when a user clicks 
        on the champion page, this color travels upward and flattens out, slides over to 
        the icon of the page that the user clicked on, and then drops down over the icon. 
        This causes the icon to become white, while the background becomes a purple gradient. 
        Once this occurs, the selected page will increase in opacity, eventually covering up the 
        last page that the user was viewing.</p>

        <div class="poggjGifs">
            <img src="../../media/videos/IDM-213-01-anim-001-kpd46_1.gif" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>The second interaction I decided to work on was the disappearance of champion 
        icons when a user clicks on the search bar. This consists of the icons moving 
        off the screen to the right, as well as the changing of opacity of the icons when 
        the user clicks on the search bar. I also chose to have each icon slide off the 
        create in a “staggered” order to make the interaction seem more dramatic.</p>

        <div class="poggjGifs">
            <img src="../../media/videos/IDM-213-01-anim-002-kpd46_1.gif" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>The third interaction I decided to work on was the appearance of icons when 
        the user is typing in champion names in the search bar. This interaction consists 
        of icons sliding to the left of the screen depending on what the user types in the 
        search bar. While they are sliding, I added a blur effect which subsides once the icons 
        make it to the left of the screen. When a user types in more letters to specify the 
        champion they are search for, icons that don’t fit the search criteria will decrease 
        in opacity, while the icons that still fit the search criteria slide over to fill in 
        the empty space.</p>

        <div class="poggjGifs">
            <img src="../../media/videos/IDM-213-01-anim-003-kpd46_1.gif" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>The fourth interaction I decided to work on was switch to the individual champion 
        page once a user clicks on a champion of which they want to view information. 
        This interaction consists of the search page sliding off the left side of the screen, 
        exposing the individual champion page. I also chose to add a blur effect while the search 
        page is sliding off the left side of the screen.</p>

        <div class="poggjGifs">
            <img src="../../media/videos/IDM-213-01-anim-004-kpd46_1.gif" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>The fifth and final interaction I decided to work on was the interaction of favoriting a 
        champion. This interaction consists of a border appearing around the champion icon on the 
        individual champion page when a user clicks on it. Since one of the main colors of the 
        redesign was purple, I chose to have the border grow in size and shift to the color purple, 
        before subsiding in size and shifting to a bright yellow.</p>

        <div class="poggjGifs">
            <img src="../../media/videos/IDM-213-01-anim-005-kpd46_1.gif" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>This project was very fun and interesting overall. I really liked the aspect of being 
            able to choose a specific app to design by ourselves, because I got the chance to 
            redesign something that I cared about personally. I feel like this project best shows 
            my creativity and capability in user centered design.</p>
