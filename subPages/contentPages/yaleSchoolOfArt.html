    <div class="textWritten">
        <p>I took a human computer interaction class during my freshman year at Drexel University. 
        For our final project, we were tasked with redesigning a website that we felt could look better 
        than it does at the moment. Our group decided on redesigning the Yale School of Art’s website, since 
        we felt that the site wasn’t very visually pleasing which surprised us because it’s an art school’s website.</p>
        
        <div class="contentImages">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleOriginalOne.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Original Screenshot One">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleOriginalTwo.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Original Screenshot Two">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleOriginalThree.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Original Screenshot Three">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleOriginalFour.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Original Screenshot Four">
        </div>

        <p>Above is how the homepage looked, and still looks like on their website. We felt that the highlighted titles were 
        very distracting to the viewer, as well as the background animations. Yes, the entire background of the homepage as 
        well as the other pages on the website are animated. Another design choice that we weren’t fans of were the colored boxes, 
        both solid and gradient, that surround most of the text and images on the website. We felt like the colors clashed with each 
        other, that they were distracting to the user, and that the content could be displayed in a much simpler, modern way than they 
        were at the moment.</p> 

        <div class="contentImages">
            <img src="../../media/images/userTestingOne.webp" alt="User Testing Screenshot One">
            <img src="../../media/images/usertestingTwo.webp" alt="User Testing Screenshot Two">
        </div>

        <p>All 4 people in my group created accounts on usertesting.com so we could collect feedback from other people who visited 
        the site. We sent the link to the website, as well as various general questions about the layout and user interface of 
        the website. Each of us collected feedback from 3 users and designed the website based on this feedback.</p>
        
        <div class="contentImages">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleNewOne.webp" alt="Yale School of Art New Screenshot One">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleNewTwo.webp" alt="Yale School of Art New Screenshot Two">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleNewThree.webp" alt="Yale School of Art New Screenshot Three">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleNewFour.webp" alt="Yale School of Art New Screenshot Four">
        </div>

        <p>I was specifically in charge of designing the footer of the site, as well as the navigation bar on the side. I chose to 
        have the navigation bar scroll with the user so that they would not have to scroll back to the top of the page to go to 
        another section of the site. For the footer, I tried spacing out all of the options as to have it feel as simple and easy 
        to understand as possible. I also helped out with general spacing of elements as well as the organization of content for the 
        overall redesign.</p>

        <p>Part of the assignment was to add a few interactions to the website to demonstrate how the flow of the design would feel. 
        The first interaction we added was to the search bar, which expands when a user clicks on it.</p>

        <div class="contentImages">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleInteractionOne.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Interaction Screenshot One">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleInteractionTwo.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Interaction Screenshot Two">
        </div>
        
        <p>The second interaction we added was to the login button at the top right of the site. This interaction consisted of a 
        login menu appearing under the login button when a user clicks on it.</p>

        <div class="contentImages">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleInteractionThree.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Interaction Screenshot Three">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleInteractionFour.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Interaction Screenshot Four">
        </div>

        <p>The third interaction was added to an article near the bottom of the page. We programmed the “Read More” clickable 
        option to take the user to another page, where the full article would be displayed. We also added the option to either 
        click the “Home” tab on the navigation bar or the title of the website at the top of the page to go back to the homepage.</p>
        
        <div class="contentImages">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleInteractionFive.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Interaction Screenshot Five">
            <img src="../../media/images/yaleInteractionSix.webp" alt="Yale School of Art Interaction Screenshot Six">
        </div>

        <p>The overall experience with working on a team to design a website was a lot of fun. We all have our different design 
        preferences and thoughts, so it was really nice to be able to come together and combine ideas to create something that 
        we are all very proud of. I’d say that this was my favorite project to work on during my freshman year at Drexel University.</p>
